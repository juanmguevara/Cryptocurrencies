# Cryptocurrencies

In our analysis we cleaned our data to ensure that we have only information relative to our classification analysis. We processed our data to fit the machine learning model, using unsupervised learning. To group the crytocurrencies, using th eclustering algorithm to help determine about investing in this product. We removed all of the cryptocurrencies that aren't trading, and removed our null values cleaning our data set. After we finished cleaning our data set we begain with our Principal Component Analysis to establish 3 different PCA values. After we created a elbow curve in order to help us determine what K-value we would use in our Kmeans analysis. I determined that the recommended K-value to use would be 4 since at that point the graph starts to plato more. Initializing our K-means model we are able to classify each of our PCA data points. Combining it with our cleaned data set we can then graph a 3D plot to help us visuallize our data set. Additionally, we created a data table and a scatter plot to generate our report findings.
